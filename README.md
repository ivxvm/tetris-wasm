# tetris-wasm
Tetris game programmed in WebAssembly **by hand**, for no good reason whatsoever! Other than learning more about WebAssembly, of course.
Could be useful to lookup usage of certain constructs and as a source of additional examples of bidirectional communication between JavaScript and WebAssembly.
Some development notes [here](https://github.com/ivxvm/tetris-wasm/blob/master/notes.md).
